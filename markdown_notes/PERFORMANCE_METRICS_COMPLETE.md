# Performance Metrics System - Complete Implementation

## Overview

The Performance Metrics System has been successfully implemented to provide comprehensive tracking and analysis of reinforcement learning training progress. This system tracks average reward per episode, counts steps to reach goals, displays learning curves, and shows convergence indicators.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Average Reward Per Episode Tracking
- **Moving Average Calculation**: Tracks moving averages of rewards over configurable windows
- **Real-time Updates**: Updates every episode with current and historical performance
- **Configurable Window Size**: Default 100 episodes, customizable per training session

### 2. Steps to Goal Counting
- **Step Tracking**: Records exact number of steps taken to reach the goal each episode
- **Moving Average Steps**: Calculates moving average of steps over time
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Shows improvement in path efficiency as training progresses

### 3. Learning Curves Display
- **Tabular Format**: Clear, formatted display of learning progress
- **Multiple Metrics**: Shows episode, reward, moving average, steps, success status, epsilon, and Q-value variance
- **Configurable Display**: Can show last N episodes (default 20-50)
- **Progress Tracking**: Periodic display during training (every 100-200 episodes)

### 4. Convergence Indicators
- **Automatic Detection**: Automatically detects when training has converged
- **Convergence Criteria**: 
  - Low reward variance (< 5.0) over threshold episodes
  - High success rate (> 80%) over threshold episodes
- **Convergence Reporting**: Reports the exact episode where convergence was detected
- **Real-time Analysis**: Continuous monitoring during training

## Implementation Details

### Core Structures

#### PerformanceMetrics Structure
```c
typedef struct {
    float* moving_avg_rewards;    // Moving average of rewards
    float* moving_avg_steps;      // Moving average of steps
    int* success_episodes;        // Episodes where goal was reached
    float* q_value_variance;      // Variance in Q-values over time
    float* epsilon_history;       // Epsilon values over time
    int window_size;              // Window size for moving averages
    int convergence_threshold;    // Episodes to check for convergence
    bool has_converged;           // Whether training has converged
    int convergence_episode;      // Episode where convergence was detected
} PerformanceMetrics;
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Training with Metrics
```c
// Create training statistics with metrics
TrainingStats* stats = create_training_stats(num_episodes);

// Training loop
for (int episode = 0; episode < num_episodes; episode++) {
    // ... run episode ...
    
    // Calculate metrics
    float q_variance = calculate_q_value_variance(agent);
    bool goal_reached = (agent_pos == goal_pos);
    
    // Record episode and update metrics
    record_episode(stats, episode, reward, steps, epsilon, avg_q);
    update_performance_metrics(stats->metrics, stats, episode, goal_reached, q_variance);
    
    // Check convergence
    if (check_convergence(stats->metrics, episode)) {
        printf("Training converged at episode %d!\n", episode + 1);
        break;
    }
    
    // Periodic reporting
    if (episode % 100 == 0) {
        print_learning_curves(stats, 20);
        print_convergence_analysis(stats->metrics, episode);
    }
}
```

    max_episodes,     // Total episodes
    50,              // Window size (smaller = more responsive)
    25               // Convergence threshold (episodes to check)
